    "# What Are Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data processing and modeling code organized.  Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but Pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "1. **Cleaner Code:** You won't need to keep track of your training (and validation) data at each step of processing.  Accounting for data at each step of processing can get messy.  With a pipeline, you don't need to manually keep track of each step.\n",
    "2. **Fewer Bugs:** There are fewer opportunities to mis-apply a step or forget a pre-processing step.\n",
    "3. **Easier to Productionize:** It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale.  We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "4. **More Options For Model Testing:** You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n",

    "Most scikit-learn objects are either **transformers** or **models.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformers** are for pre-processing before modeling.  The Imputer class (for filling in missing values) is an example of a transformer.  Over time, you will learn many more transformers, and you will frequently use multiple transformers sequentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Models** are used to make predictions. You will usually preprocess your data (with transformers) before putting it in a model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can tell if an object is a transformer or a model by how you apply it.  After fitting a transformer, you apply it with the *transform* command.  After fitting a model, you apply it with the *predict* command. Your pipeline must start with transformer steps and end with a model.  This is what you'd want anyway.\n",
