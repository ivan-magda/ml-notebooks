In this step, you will learn what data leakage is and how to prevent it.* \n\n\n# What is Data Leakage\nData leakage is one of the most important issues for a data scientist to understand. If you don't know how to prevent it, leakage will come up frequently, and it will ruin your models in the most subtle and dangerous ways.  Specifically, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate. This tutorial will show you what leakage is and how to avoid it.\n\nThere are two main types of leakage: **Leaky Predictors** and a **Leaky Validation Strategies.**\n\n## Leaky Predictors\nThis occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. \n\nFor example, imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data might look like this:\n\n| got_pneumonia | age | weight |  male | took_antibiotic_medicine | ... |\n|:-------------:|:---:|:------:|:-----:|:------------------------:|-----|\n|     False     |  65 |   100  | False |           False          | ... |\n|     False     |  72 |   130  |  True |           False          | ... |\n|      True     |  58 |   100  | False |           True           | ... |\n-\n\n\nPeople take antibiotic medicines after getting pneumonia in order to recover. So the raw data shows a strong relationship between those columns. But *took_antibiotic_medicine* is frequently changed **after** the value for *got_pneumonia* is determined. This is target leakage.\n\nThe model would see that anyone who has a value of `False` for `took_antibiotic_medicine` didn't have pneumonia.  Validation data comes from the same source, so the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores. But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world.\n\nTo prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded. Because when we use this model to make new predictions, that data won't be available to the model.\n\n![Leaky Data Graphic](https://i.imgur.com/CN4INKb.png)"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"cca14623-d55f-49ba-8907-501e9ac2acca","_uuid":"e5a3cf9b1bd44f7d2c8e8672b9e8594150d30ad6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Leaky Validation Strategy\n\nA much different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful distinguishing training data from validation data.  For example, this happens if you run preprocessing (like fitting the Imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split.  Validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data it hasn't considered before.  You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavoir..  The end result?  Your model will get very good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n\n\n## Preventing Leaky Predictors\nThere is no single solution that universally prevents leaky predictors. It requires knowledge about your data, case-specific inspection and common sense.\n\nHowever, leaky predictors frequently have high statistical correlations to the target.  So two tactics to keep in mind:\n* To screen for possible leaky predictors, look for columns that are statistically correlated to your target.\n* If you build a model and find it extremely accurate, you likely have a leakage problem.\n\n## Preventing Leaky Validation Strategies\n\nIf your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of *fitting*, including the fitting of preprocessing steps.  This is easier if you use [scikit-learn Pipelines](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/pipelines).  When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you use pipelines and do your preprocessing inside the pipeline.\n\n# Example\nWe will use a small dataset about credit card applications, and we will build a model predicting which applications were accepted (stored in a variable called *card*).

However, we can expect it to be right about 80% of the time when used on new applications, whereas the leaky model would likely do much worse then that (even in spite of it's higher apparent score in cross-validation.).\n\n# Conclusion\nData leakage can be multi-million dollar mistake in many data science applications. Careful separation of training and validation data is a first step, and pipelines can help implement this separation.  Leaking predictors are a more frequent issue, and leaking predictors are harder to track down. A combination of caution, common sense and data exploration can help identify leaking predictors so you remove them from your model.\n\n# Exercise\nReview the data in your ongoing project.  Are there any predictors that may cause leakage?  As a hint, most datasets from Kaggle competitions don't have these variables. Once you get past those carefully curated datasets, this becomes a common issue.\n\nClick **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning)** to return the main page for *Learning Machine Learning.*"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
