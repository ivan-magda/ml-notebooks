    "# Introduction\n",
    "Categorical data is data that takes only a limited number of values.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you people responded to a survey about which what brand of car they owned, the result would be categorical (because the answers would be things like _Honda_,  _Toyota_, _Ford_, _None_, etc.). Responses fall into\n",
    "a fixed set of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get an error if you try to plug these variables into most machine learning models in Python without \"encoding\" them first.  Here we'll show the most popular method for encoding categorical variables.\n",

    "## One-Hot Encoding : The Standard Approach for Categorical Data\n",
    "One hot encoding is the most widespread approach, and it works very well unless your categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e. you generally won't it for variables taking more than 15 different values.  It'd be a poor choice in some cases with fewer values, though that varies.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One hot encoding creates new (binary) columns, indicating the presence of each possible value from the original data.  Let's work through an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mtimFxh.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The values in the original data are _Red_, _Yellow_ and _Green_.  We create a separate column for each possible value. Wherever the original value was _Red_, we put a 1 in the _Red_ column.  \n",

    "# Example\n",

    "Let's see this in code. We'll skip the basic data set-up code, so you can start at the point where you have **train_predictors**, **test_predictors** DataFrames. This data contains housing characteristics. You will use them to predict home prices, which are stored  in a Series called **target**.\n"

Unfortunately, it doesn't handle text or object values, which is a common use case. \n",
