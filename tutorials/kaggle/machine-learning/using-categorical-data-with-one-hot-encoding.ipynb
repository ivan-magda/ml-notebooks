In this step, you will learn what a \"categorical\" variable is, as well as the most common approach for handling this type of data.* \n\n\n# Introduction\nCategorical data is data that takes only a limited number of values.  \n\nFor example, if you people responded to a survey about which what brand of car they owned, the result would be categorical (because the answers would be things like _Honda_,  _Toyota_, _Ford_, _None_, etc.). Responses fall into\na fixed set of categories.\n\nYou will get an error if you try to plug these variables into most machine learning models in Python without \"encoding\" them first.  Here we'll show the most popular method for encoding categorical variables.\n\n---\n\n## One-Hot Encoding : The Standard Approach for Categorical Data\nOne hot encoding is the most widespread approach, and it works very well unless your categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e. you generally won't it for variables taking more than 15 different values.  It'd be a poor choice in some cases with fewer values, though that varies.)\n\nOne hot encoding creates new (binary) columns, indicating the presence of each possible value from the original data.  Let's work through an example.\n\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mtimFxh.png)\n\nThe values in the original data are _Red_, _Yellow_ and _Green_.  We create a separate column for each possible value. Wherever the original value was _Red_, we put a 1 in the _Red_ column.  \n\n---\n\n# Example\n\nLet's see this in code. We'll skip the basic data set-up code, so you can start at the point where you have **train_predictors**, **test_predictors** DataFrames. This data contains housing characteristics. You will use them to predict home prices, which are stored  in a Series called **target**.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b12ae16b-dafa-4ec8-8952-bea07439bde6","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"ffb9bd72c749da12d5a15bd3438889d6f6fce16c","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read the data\nimport pandas as pd\ntrain_data = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Drop houses where the target is missing\ntrain_data.dropna(axis=0, subset=['SalePrice'], inplace=True)\n\ntarget = train_data.SalePrice\n\n# Since missing values isn't the focus of this tutorial, we use the simplest\n# possible approach, which drops these columns. \n# For more detail (and a better approach) to missing values, see\n# https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/handling-missing-values\ncols_with_missing = [col for col in train_data.columns \n                                 if train_data[col].isnull().any()]                                  \ncandidate_train_predictors = train_data.drop(['Id', 'SalePrice'] + cols_with_missing, axis=1)\ncandidate_test_predictors = test_data.drop(['Id'] + cols_with_missing, axis=1)\n\n# \"cardinality\" means the number of unique values in a column.\n# We use it as our only way to select categorical columns here.

The argument `join='left'` specifies that we will do the equivalent of SQL's _left join_.  That means, if there are ever columns that show up in one dataset and not the other, we will keep exactly the columns from our training data.  The argument `join='inner'` would do what SQL databases call an _inner join_, keeping only the columns showing up in both datasets.  That's also a sensible choice.\n\n# Conclusion\nThe world is filled with categorical data. You will be a much more effective data scientist if you know how to use this data. Here are resources that will be useful as you start doing more sophisticated work with cateogircal data.\n\n* **Pipelines:** Deploying models into production ready systems is a topic unto itself. While one-hot encoding is still a great approach, your code will need to built in an especially robust way.  Scikit-learn pipelines are a great tool for this. Scikit-learn offers a [class for one-hot encoding](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) and this can be added to a Pipeline.  Unfortunately, it doesn't handle text or object values, which is a common use case. \n\n* **Applications To Text for Deep Learning:** [Keras](https://keras.io/preprocessing/text/#one_hot) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/one_hot) have fuctionality for one-hot encoding, which is useful for working with text.\n\n* **Categoricals with Many Values:** Scikit-learn's [FeatureHasher](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher) uses [the hashing trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing) to store high-dimensional data.  This will add some complexity to your modeling code.\n\n# Your Turn\nUse one-hot encoding to allow categoricals in your course project.  Then add some categorical columns to your **X** data. If you choose the right variables, your model will improve quite a bit.
