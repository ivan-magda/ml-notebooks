In most (though not necessarily all) applications, the relevant measure of model quality is predictive accuracy. In other words, will the model's predictions be close to what actually happens.\n", "\n", "Some people try answering this problem by making predictions with their *training data*. They compare those predictions to the actual target values in the *training data*. This approach has a critical shortcoming, which you will see in a moment (and which you'll subsequently see how to solve).\n", "\n", "Even with this simple approach, you'll need to summarize the model quality into a form that someone can understand. If you have predicted and actual home values for 10000 houses, you will inevitably end up with a mix of good and bad predictions. Looking through such a long list would be pointless.\n", "\n", "There are many metrics for summarizing model quality, but we'll start with one called Mean Absolute Error (also called MAE). Let's break down this metric starting with the last word, error.\n", "\n", "The prediction error for each house is: <br>\n", "error=actual\u2212predicted\n", " \n", "So, if a house cost \\$150,000 and you predicted it would cost \\$100,000 the error is \\$50,000.\n", "\n", "With the MAE metric, we take the absolute value of each error.
